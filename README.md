## AI Usage

During this challenge, I used AI tools minimally:

- **ChatGPT**: for clarifying some concepts like WebSocket flow and async handling.
- **GitHub Copilot**: for autocompleting repetitive TypeScript syntax, but the core logic and structure were written by me.

All business logic, API design, and project structure were done manually.
